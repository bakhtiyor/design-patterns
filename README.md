## What is a Design Pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

## Implemented Design Patterns

- Creational patterns - These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    - [Factory Design Pattern - [Sample 1]](https://refactoring.guru/ru/design-patterns/factory-method)
    - [Factory Design Pattern - [Sample 2]](https://youtu.be/ub0DXaeV6hA)
    - [Singleton Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/ru/design-patterns/singleton)
    - [Prototype Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/ru/design-patterns/prototype)
- Structural patterns - These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
    - [Adapter Design Pattern - [Sample 1]](https://refactoring.guru/ru/design-patterns/adapter)
    - [Adapter Design Pattern - [Sample 2]](https://youtu.be/qG286LQM6BU)
    - [Bridge Design Pattern](https://youtu.be/9jIgSsIfh_8)
    - [Facade Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/ru/design-patterns/facade)
- Behavioral patterns - These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
